  desc "Execute external command with environment variables populated from Conjur"
  long_desc <<'RUNLONGDESC' 
Processes environment configuration (see env:help for details), and executes a command (with optional arguments) in the modified environment.
Local names are uppercased and used as names of environment variables. 

Consider following environment configuration: 

{ key_pair_name: jenkins_key, ssh_keypair_path: !tmp jenkins/private_key, api_key: !var jenkins/api_key }

Values of the variables "jenkins/private_key" and "jenkins/api_key" will be obtained from Conjur. Value of "jenkins/api_key" will be associated with local name 'api_key'. Value of "jenkins/private_key" will be stored in the temporary file, which name will be associated with local name "ssh_keypair_path". 

Than, external command with appropriate arguments will be launched in the environment which has following variables:

KEY_PAIR_NAME="jenkins_key",
SSH_KEYPAIR_PATH="/dev/shm/temp_file_with_key_obtained_from_Conjur",
API_KEY="api key obtained from Conjur"

  arg_name "-- command [arg1, arg2 ...] "

  desc "Render ERB template with variables obtained from Conjur"
  long_desc <<'TEMPLATEDESC' 
Processes environment configuration (see env:help for details), and creates a temporary file, which contains result of ERB template rendering in appropriate context.
Template should refer to Conjur values by local name as "%<= conjurenv['local_name'] %>".

Consider following environment configuration: 

{ key_pair_name: jenkins_key, ssh_keypair_path: !tmp jenkins/private_key, api_key: !var jenkins/api_key }

Values of the variables "jenkins/private_key" and "jenkins/api_key" will be obtained from Conjur. Value of "jenkins/api_key" will be associated with local name 'api_key'. Value of "jenkins/private_key" will be stored in the temporary file, which name will be associated with local name "ssh_keypair_path". 

Than, following template 

key_pair=<%= conjurenv["key_pair_name"] %>, path_to_ssh_key= <%= conjurenv["ssh_keypair_path"] %>, api_key = '<%= conjurenv["api_key"] %>'

will be rendered to 

key_pair=jenkins_key, path_to_ssh_key=/dev/shm/temp_file_with_key_obtained_from_Conjur, api_key='api key obtained from Conjur'

Result of the rendering will be stored in temporary file, which location is than printed to stdout

      puts """
Environment configuration (either stored in file referred by -f option or provided inline with --yaml option) should be a YAML document describing one-level Hash.
Keys of the hash are 'local names', used to refer to variable values in convenient manner.  (See help for env:run and env:template for more details about how they are interpreted).

Values of the hash may take one of the following forms: a) string b) string preceeded with !var tag c) string preceeded with !tmp tag.

a) Plain string is just associated with local name without any calls to Conjur.

b) String preceeded by !var tag is interpreted as an ID of the Conjur variable, which value should be obtained and associated with appropriate local name.

c) String preceeded by !tmp tag is interpreted as an ID of the Conjur variable, which value should be stored in temporary file, which location should in turn be associated with appropriate local name.

Example of environment configuration: 

{ local_variable_1: 'literal value', local_variable_2: !var id/of/Conjur/Variable , local_variable_3: !tmp id/of/another/Conjur/variable }
