class Conjur::Command::Bootstrap < Conjur::Command
  desc "Create initial users, groups, and permissions"
  long_desc %Q(When you launch a new Conjur master server, it contains only one login: the "admin" user. 
  The bootstrap command will finish the setup of a new Conjur system by creating other essential records.

  Actions performed by "bootstrap" include:

  * Creation of a group called "security_admin".

  * Giving the "security_admin" the power to manage public keys.

  * Creation of a user called "attic", which will be the owner of retired records.

  * Storing the "attic" user's API key in a variable called "conjur/users/attic/api-key".

  * (optional) Create a new user who will be made a member and admin of the "security_admin" group.

  * (optional) If a new user was created, login as that user.
  )
  
  # Determines whether the current logged-in user is sufficiently powerful to perform bootstrap.
  # This is currently determined by detecting whether the logged-in role:
  #
  # * Is a user
  # * Has admin privilege on the security_admin group role
  # * Is an owner of the security_admin group resource
  #
  # The admin user will always satisfy these conditions, unless they are revoked for some reason.
  # Other users created by the bootstrap command will (typically) also have these powers.
