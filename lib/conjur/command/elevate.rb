If you are allowed to do this by the Conjur server, all server-side permission checks will be bypassed and any
action will be allowed.

To be able to run this command, you must have the 'elevate' privilege on the resource '!:!:conjur'.

EXAMPLE

Force retirement of a user:

$ conjur elevate user retire alice
  DESC
  command :elevate do |c|
    c.action do |global_options,options,args|
      exit_now! "Subcommand is required" if args.empty?
      
      Conjur::Command.api = api.with_privilege "elevate"
      subcommand args
    end
  end
  
  desc "Run a sub-command in 'reveal' mode"
  long_desc <<-DESC
If you are allowed to do this by the Conjur server, you can inspect all data in the Conjur
authorization service. For example, you can list and search for all resources, regardless of
your ownership and privileges. You can also show details on any resource, and you can perform
permission checks on any resource.

To be able to run this command, you must have the 'reveal' privilege on the resource '!:!:conjur'.

EXAMPLE

List all groups:

$ conjur reveal group list -i

  DESC
  command :reveal do |c|
    c.action do |global_options,options,args|
      exit_now! "Subcommand is required" if args.empty?
      
      Conjur::Command.api = api.with_privilege "reveal"
      subcommand args
    end
  end
end
